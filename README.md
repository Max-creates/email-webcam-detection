# 👁️ Email Webcam Motion Detection

A Python app that monitors your webcam for motion (people or objects) and instantly sends an email with an image when motion is detected.

## 🔧 Features
- Detects motion using webcam feed (via OpenCV)
- Sends an email alert with the captured image
- Great for basic home or workspace surveillance

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repo:
2. Install the required package: pip install opencv-python
3. Set up your email settings inside `emailing.py` (sender, receiver, password).

## ▶️ Run the App

## ⚠️ Note
Email credentials are hardcoded for now — for safety, consider moving them to environment variables or a config file.

📬 Simple. Fast. Useful for motion-triggered email alerts.
